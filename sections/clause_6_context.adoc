== Context

=== Standardization Goal

The goal of this profile is to ensure interoperabilty between Vertical extent demo data implementations of the OGC API-Environmental Data Retrieval Standard (OGC API-EDR).

The OGC API-EDR Standard does not try to address every possible application domain. Rather, it provides a foundation which can be tailored for a specific domain. The result of this tailoring is a domain specific "profile" of the OGC API-EDR Standard.
